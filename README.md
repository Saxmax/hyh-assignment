# Work assignment

The goal of this assignment is to implement a coin fountain. The effect creates the illusion of a large number of rotating coins that spring out of the center of the screen upwards for then to be pulled down by the force of gravity when they appear to be closer to the screen.

Requisites

The solution will be implemented using the included version of PIXI.js. No other external libraries are to be used.

Use only standard ECMAScript (Javascript) 202x.

The coins will be managed by some form of particle system that you implement.

Think about the following.

- smooth animations
- rotation axis
- is it beautiful
- ease of configuration

Good luck, 

from the Hold Your Hat team!
